      A woman lingers near a fresh grave, though she doesn't look like she's mourning. She's studying the grounds—the

      She's in her 20s, with the calloused hands of someone who's worked a dozen more. Her eyes are sharp, wary.

      The Aldworth manor dominates the corner of Town Square—three stories of gray stone, its windows watching the

      He goes pale. For a moment you think he might call for the guard. Then his shoulders sag.


      "How much do you know?"


      "Enough to ask questions. Not enough to answer them."


      He looks around, then steps closer. His voice drops. "My father... made mistakes. The maid's mother was one of
      them. She was his daughter. Illegitimate, unacknowledged, but his."


      He meets your eyes. "That woman—Maren—she's my father's granddaughter. She scrubbed our floors for twenty years,

      "He said it was the only honest thing he ever did for her. Keeping her face close. Even if she never knew."

      "If the locket finds its way to Maren. Quietly. No questions."


      "...Come to the servants' entrance tomorrow. Early. It will be there."

      He turns on his heel and strides into the manor. The door closes firmly behind him.

      You linger near a market stall, watching. Aldworth conducts his business with clipped efficiency—signing papers,
      giving orders, accepting condolences with practiced grace.


      But twice, you notice him glance toward the church. Something weighs on him.


      A servant emerges from the manor with a message. As she passes near you, she mutters to another: "Third time he's

      "Maren?" The servant's expression shifts—sympathy, maybe. "Poor thing. Gave her whole life to this house and got
      turned out the week the old master died. Young Aldworth didn't even give her a reference."

      Her mother was old Aldworth's daughter. Illegitimate, unacknowledged, but his blood. That makes Maren his
      granddaughter. Young Aldworth's cousin—or near enough. She served twenty years in her own grandfather's house, and
      he never told her.


      She doesn't speak for a long moment. When she does, her voice is flat.


      "Twenty years. Twenty years I scrubbed his floors. Called him 'sir.' And he knew. He knew what I was to him."

      You raise your hands. "We surrender."


      The watchman's lantern swings toward Maren, still half-crouched by the open grave. Her fingers are wrapped around
      something small—the locket.


      "Both of them," the watchman calls. More boots on gravel. More lights.


      As they bind your hands, Maren catches your eye. She's still holding the locket. Whatever comes next, she has her
      mother's face.

      You step out from behind the gravestone, hands raised. "Evening, watchman. Bit late for a stroll?"


      He swings the lantern toward you, suspicious. Behind him, in the darkness, you hear the quiet scrape of metal on
      wood.

      You spin a story—paying respects to a lost friend, didn't realize the hour, so sorry to disturb. The watchman is
      skeptical but not suspicious enough to search the grounds.


      By the time he moves on, Maren is gone. You find her later, at the edge of town, clutching the locket.


      "You got it."


      She opens it to show you. Two portraits. The truth, held in the palm of her hand.


      "Because of you," she says. "I won't forget."

      The watchman doesn't buy it. His eyes narrow, and he blows his whistle before you can stop him.


      They find the grave disturbed. They find Maren hiding behind a mausoleum, locket clutched to her chest. They find
      you with dirt on your boots and lies on your tongue.


      "Both of them," the captain says. "Let the magistrate sort it out."


      As they lead you away, Maren mouths two words: "Thank you."


      Whatever comes next, she has her mother's face. You gave her that much.

      You need to draw the watch away from the graveyard. There are a few possibilities.


      You could start a commotion at the Tavern—a fight, perhaps, or a false alarm. You could report a suspicious figure
      at the Port. Or you could simply wait for the watch to pass and hope Maren is fast enough.

      The fight you start at the Tavern is convincing enough to draw three watchmen off their rounds. By the time order
      is restored, you're long gone—and so is Maren.


      You find her at dawn, waiting outside your door. She looks exhausted but triumphant.


      "I got it." She shows you the locket. Two portraits. "I know who I am now."


      She doesn't explain what the portraits mean. She doesn't have to.


      "Thank you. For everything."

      Your report of suspicious activity at the Port sends half the night watch running. The graveyard is deserted for
      nearly an hour.


      Maren makes good use of the time.


      You find her at dawn, locket in hand, eyes red from weeping or sleeplessness or both.


      "It's done," she says. "I know who I am."


      The guards will wonder about your false report. Best to lay low for a while.

      Your distraction draws attention—but not away from the graveyard. Toward it. Toward you.


      By the time you realize your mistake, it's too late. The watch finds Maren with her hands in the dirt.


      They arrest you both.


      The magistrate is not lenient with grave robbers, even accomplices. Even those who never touched the grave
      themselves.

      You wait at the edge of town, listening to the night. An hour passes. Two.

      At dawn, Maren finds you. Dirt under her fingernails. Exhaustion in her eyes. And in her hand, the locket.

      "I did it," she says. "Alone. But knowing you were here—that someone would know if I didn't come back—"

      She opens the locket. Two portraits. A truth she'll carry forever.

      "Thank you."

      The Aldworth manor looms in the evening light. Maren hesitates at the servants' entrance—habit—then straightens
      and walks to the front door.


      Young Aldworth answers himself. His expression shifts from annoyance to alarm when he sees who it is.


      "You. I told you—"


      "I know what's in the locket," Maren says. Her voice doesn't waver. "I know what my mother was to your father.
      What I am to you."


      The color drains from his face.

      Aldworth's face cycles through shock, denial, and finally a kind of desperate calculation.

      "You don't understand," he says. "If this gets out—the family name—"

      "I don't care about your family name," Maren says. "I care about my mother's locket."

      He looks between the two of you, cornered.

      "Give her the locket," you say. "Now. Or the whole town learns what the Aldworths have been hiding."

      Then his shoulders slump.

      "Wait here."

      He returns with the locket. Shoves it at Maren without meeting her eyes.

      "Take it. And never come here again. Never speak of this. To anyone."

      Maren opens it right there on the doorstep. The two portraits. Proof.

      "I don't want your money," she says quietly. "I don't want your name. I just wanted my mother's face."

      She walks away without looking back. You follow, leaving Aldworth in his doorway, watching you go.

      He'll be an enemy now. But Maren has what she needed.

      It's enough.

      You find a moment alone with Aldworth near the manor. No witnesses. No servants within earshot.

      "A word about your father's burial."

      His expression tightens. "What about it?"

      "The locket he was buried with. It belonged to his daughter. Not your sister—the other one."

      He goes very still.

      "You'll keep this quiet?"

      His face contorts with rage—then fear—then a kind of exhausted defeat.


      "You're no different from any other blackmailer."


      "Maybe not. But Maren deserves her mother's locket. Make this right."

      The locket is there the next morning, wrapped in cloth, left on the step like something shameful.


      You bring it to Maren. She opens it with trembling hands. Two portraits. The truth.


      "How did you—"


      "The Aldworths owed you. I helped them see that."


      She doesn't ask for details. Maybe she understands. Maybe she doesn't want to know.


      "Thank you," she says. "For everything."


      Somewhere in the manor, young Aldworth is wondering what you might do with what you know. That's a problem for
      another day.


      Today, Maren has her mother's face. It's enough.

      You hear she left town the next day. No one knows where she went. The locket stays buried with old Aldworth, and
      the truth stays buried with it.


      Sometimes you wonder if you did the right thing.


      You never find out for certain.
