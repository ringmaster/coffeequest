      {{hermit.name}} laughs bitterly. "Who? The bookie's men. Debt collectors. Killers, maybe, if he's tired of
      waiting." He runs a hand through matted hair. "I owe more than I can ever repay. So I came here. Where no one
      would look." His eyes narrow. "But you found me. How?"

      "Emberroot?" {{hermit.name}} grunts. "I harvest it. Trade it to travelers for supplies—when any come through." He
      jerks his head toward a bundle of red-veined leaves drying on a rack. "Take some. And then go. I don't need
      company."

      {{hermit.name}} is very still. When he speaks, his voice is rough. "{{apothecary.name}}." It's not a question. "My

      "No. He wouldn't." {{hermit.name}} stares at the ground. "I took money from the business. Our business. To pay
      gambling debts. When I couldn't cover what I owed the bookie, I ran. Left {{apothecary.name}} to deal with the
      mess." He looks up. "It was the only way to keep him safe. If I'd stayed, the bookie would have come for us both."

      emberroot while you're gone. Come back with news—good or bad. I need to know where I stand."

      You push through the thicket to {{hermit.name}}'s camp. He's waiting, tense, a bundle of fresh emberroot in his

      "Tell him I'm sorry. Tell him I'll come see him soon. If he'll have me."
