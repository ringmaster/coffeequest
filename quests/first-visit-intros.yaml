  # === Northern Row ===

  - id: "@patch:Haunted Grove"
    tags: ["!level>1", "!visited:haunted_grove", "+visited:haunted_grove"]
    text:
      prepend: >
        Gnarled trees twist toward a bruised sky, their branches clawing at the mist
        that clings to everything. The air is thick with the scent of decay and
        something older—something watching.


  - id: "@patch:Forest"
    tags: ["!level>1", "!visited:forest", "+visited:forest"]
    text:
      prepend: >
        Sunlight filters through the canopy in golden shafts, illuminating a carpet
        of fallen leaves. Bird calls echo between ancient oaks, and a well-worn path
        winds deeper into the green.


  - id: "@patch:Mud Pit"
    tags: ["!level>1", "!visited:mud_pit", "+visited:mud_pit"]
    text:
      prepend: >
        A churned expanse of thick brown mud stretches before you, dotted with
        wooden planks that serve as treacherous walkways. The smell is earthy and
        pungent, and something large shifts beneath the surface.


  # === Second Row ===

  - id: "@patch:Field"
    tags: ["!level>1", "!visited:field", "+visited:field"]
    text:
      prepend: >
        Golden wheat sways in gentle waves under the open sky. Scarecrows stand
        sentinel at intervals, their button eyes following your movement with
        unsettling patience.


  - id: "@patch:Farmhouse"
    tags: ["!level>1", "!visited:farmhouse", "+visited:farmhouse"]
    text:
      prepend: >
        A sturdy stone farmhouse sits amid vegetable gardens and chicken coops.
        Smoke curls from the chimney, carrying the promise of warm bread and
        honest conversation.


  - id: "@patch:Tavern"
    tags: ["!level>1", "!visited:tavern", "+visited:tavern"]
    text:
      prepend: >
        Raucous laughter and the clink of tankards spill through the tavern's
        weathered doors. A faded sign creaks overhead, and the smell of roasted
        meat beckons you inside.


  # === Third Row ===

  - id: "@patch:Old Mill"
    tags: ["!level>1", "!visited:old_mill", "+visited:old_mill"]
    text:
      prepend: >
        The great wheel turns slowly, groaning with age as water cascades over
        its mossy paddles. Flour dust drifts from the windows like lazy snow,
        and the stones rumble with endless grinding.


  - id: "@patch:Stables"
    tags: ["!level>1", "!visited:stables", "+visited:stables"]
    text:
      prepend: >
        The warm smell of hay and horse envelops you as you approach the wooden
        stables. Magnificent steeds peer over their stall doors with intelligent
        eyes, while stable hands hurry about their duties.


  - id: "@patch:Inn"
    tags: ["!level>1", "!visited:inn", "+visited:inn"]
    text:
      prepend: >
        A welcoming glow emanates from the inn's mullioned windows. The building
        leans slightly with age but radiates warmth and the promise of a soft bed
        and hot meal.


  # === Fourth Row ===

  - id: "@patch:Graveyard"
    tags: ["!level>1", "!visited:graveyard", "+visited:graveyard"]
    text:
      prepend: >
        Weathered headstones lean at odd angles among overgrown grass. A wrought-iron
        fence surrounds the quiet grounds, its gate hanging open with a mournful creak.
        The dead rest here—mostly.


  - id: "@patch:Town Square"
    tags: ["!level>1", "!visited:town_square", "+visited:town_square"]
    text:
      prepend: >
        The heart of the village bustles with activity. A stone fountain burbles
        at the center, surrounded by townsfolk going about their daily business.
        Notice boards plaster the walls with requests and warnings.


  - id: "@patch:Guardhouse"
    tags: ["!level>1", "!visited:guardhouse", "+visited:guardhouse"]
    text:
      prepend: >
        A squat stone building flies the town's banner from its peaked roof.
        Guards in worn armor lounge by the entrance, their watchful eyes tracking
        everyone who passes.


  # === Fifth Row ===

  - id: "@patch:Church"
    tags: ["!level>1", "!visited:church", "+visited:church"]
    text:
      prepend: >
        Stained glass windows cast rainbow light across worn pews. The scent of
        incense hangs in the air, and somewhere above, bells wait in patient silence.
        A sense of peace—or perhaps something more—settles over you.


  - id: "@patch:Market"
    tags: ["!level>1", "!visited:market", "+visited:market"]
    text:
      prepend: >
        A riot of colors and sounds assaults your senses. Merchants hawk their wares
        from crowded stalls, customers haggle fiercely, and the smell of exotic spices
        mingles with fresh bread and ripe fruit.


  - id: "@patch:Armory"
    tags: ["!level>1", "!visited:armory", "+visited:armory"]
    text:
      prepend: >
        Steel gleams from every surface. Swords, shields, and suits of armor line
        the walls in deadly array. The proprietor eyes you with the calculating
        gaze of someone who knows the price of violence.


  # === Sixth Row ===

  - id: "@patch:Library"
    tags: ["!level>1", "!visited:library", "+visited:library"]
    text:
      prepend: >
        Towering shelves groan under the weight of countless tomes. Dust motes
        dance in shafts of light from high windows, and the musty smell of old
        paper fills your lungs. Knowledge—and perhaps secrets—waits here.


  - id: "@patch:Bakery"
    tags: ["!level>1", "!visited:bakery", "+visited:bakery"]
    text:
      prepend: >
        Warmth and the intoxicating aroma of fresh bread wash over you. Golden
        loaves cool on racks, pastries glisten with sugar, and the baker works
        with flour-dusted hands.


  - id: "@patch:Blacksmith"
    tags: ["!level>1", "!visited:blacksmith", "+visited:blacksmith"]
    text:
      prepend: >
        Heat radiates from the forge in waves, and the ring of hammer on steel
        echoes rhythmically. Sparks fly like angry fireflies as molten metal
        bends to the smith's will.


  # === Seventh Row ===

  - id: "@patch:Island"
    tags: ["!level>1", "!visited:island", "+visited:island"]
    text:
      prepend: >
        A small island rises from the water, accessible only by a rickety wooden
        bridge. Seabirds wheel overhead, and the salt breeze carries whispers of
        secrets the mainland has forgotten.


  - id: "@patch:Port"
    tags: ["!level>1", "!visited:port", "+visited:port"]
    text:
      prepend: >
        Ships of all sizes bob at anchor, their masts a forest of wood and rope.
        Sailors load cargo while merchants argue over prices, and the cry of
        gulls mingles with shouted orders.


  - id: "@patch:Seamstress"
    tags: ["!level>1", "!visited:seamstress", "+visited:seamstress"]
    text:
      prepend: >
        Bolts of fabric in every imaginable color line the walls. A nimble-fingered
        seamstress works at her station, needle flashing, while half-finished
        garments hang like elegant ghosts.
