      You step between them. {{master.name}} blinks in surprise—{{master.he}}
      thought {{master.he}} had you convinced.


      "I heard your side. A contract's a contract, you said." You meet
      {{master.his}} eyes. "But tracking someone for two months? That's
      not about tools. That's about making an example."


      {{master.name}} sputters, but {{master.he}} doesn't advance.
      {{runaway.name}} stares at you, stunned, then grabs your sleeve.

      You grab {{master.name}}'s arm before {{master.he}} can lunge.
      {{runaway.name}} doesn't hesitate—{{runaway.he}} bolts for the
      back door, bottle clattering to the floor.


      {{master.name}} tries to shake you off. "Let go—!"


      "It's over." You hold firm until {{runaway.name}} disappears into
      the alley. By the time {{master.name}} breaks free, there's no one
      to chase.


      "I'll remember your face," {{master.name}} snarls. "This isn't

      You haul {{runaway.name}} up while {{master.name}} is still reeling.
      "Go. Forest. Now." {{runaway.name}} stumbles toward the back door,
      blood matting {{runaway.his}} hair. {{runaway.He}} can barely walk.


      {{master.name}} tries to follow, but {{master.his}} arm won't
      cooperate. "This isn't over," {{master.he}} snarls at you. "I know
      your face."


      You watch {{runaway.name}} disappear into the alley, weaving.
      Whether {{runaway.he}}'ll make it to the forest—whether {{runaway.he}}'ll
      survive the head wound—is another question entirely.

      You take back alleys toward the forest edge, {{runaway.name}}
      following close. {{master.name}}'s shouts fade behind you. When you
      reach the treeline, {{runaway.name}} stops.


      "I can make it from here. There's a charcoal-burner's camp deeper
      in—they don't ask questions." {{runaway.He}} presses something into
      your hand—a silver coin, worn smooth. "It's all I have. But I won't
      forget this."


      {{runaway.He}} disappears into the shadows between the trees. You
      stood against the law for someone who might have been a thief—or
      might have been a slave in all but name. The distinction feels
      blurrier than it should.

      You catch up to {{runaway.name}} in the alley. {{runaway.He}}'s
      leaning against a wall, pressing a hand to {{runaway.his}} head.
      Blood wells between {{runaway.his}} fingers.


      "The forest," {{runaway.he}} manages. "I can make it."


      You half-carry {{runaway.him}} to the treeline. {{runaway.He}}
      doesn't have the strength to offer you anything—not even thanks.
      Just a look, and then {{runaway.he}}'s stumbling into the shadows.


      You helped someone escape. Whether {{runaway.he}}'ll live to
      appreciate it is beyond your power now.

      "Wait." Both of them look at you. "{{master.name}}—you've spent two
      months and good silver chasing {{runaway.him}}. You want your tools
      back and your pride satisfied. {{runaway.name}}—you want out of a
      contract you say was broken first. Neither of you is getting what
      you want right now."


      You let that sit for a moment. "There might be a way. {{runaway.name}}
      pays for the tools. {{master.name}} releases the contract. Everyone
      walks away."


      They glance at each other. Neither likes it. But neither says no.

      "STOP." The word cuts through the tension. {{runaway.name}}'s
      knuckles are white on the bottle neck. {{master.name}}'s hands are
      raised, ready to grapple. Both freeze.


      "You're about to get blood on this floor. Is that what either of
      you wants?" You step between them, heart hammering. "There's a way
      out of this that doesn't end with the guard involved."


      {{master.name}}'s jaw works. {{runaway.name}}'s breath comes ragged.

      It takes an hour of haggling. {{runaway.name}} doesn't have money,
      but the innkeeper—desperate to end this—offers to cover the cost of
      the tools in exchange for six months of {{runaway.name}}'s labor at
      the inn. {{master.name}} gets {{master.his}} silver and a signed
      release. {{runaway.name}} gets a job and freedom, eventually.


      Neither is happy. Both accept.


      "You've got a talent for finding the middle," the innkeeper says
      afterward, pressing a silver coin into your hand. "Not everyone does."


      You brokered peace. It wasn't justice for anyone—just the least
      unjust outcome available.

      You fetch the healer from the church. By the time you return,
      {{master.name}} has {{runaway.name}} in a chair, both of them too
      bloodied and dazed to fight. The healer clicks her tongue at the
      mess and sets to work.


      In the end, {{master.name}} accepts a settlement—{{runaway.name}}
      will work at the inn to pay off the tools, and the guild master
      gets silver for {{master.his}} trouble and medical costs. Neither
      party is happy. Both are bandaged.


      "Funny time to find your conscience," the innkeeper mutters,
      pressing nothing into your hand.


      You didn't choose a side. You waited until there were no good
      choices left, then picked the least bad one. That's something.
      Maybe.

      The inn feels the same as it ever did. If something happened here
      once—some commotion you chose not to see—there's no sign of it now.

      The inn is quieter since the incident. The innkeeper nods at you—respect,
