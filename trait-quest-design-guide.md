# Coffee Quest: Designing Meaningful Trait Choices

## Overview

This guide covers how to design quests where player choices award traits from the game's core axes. A trait choice is only meaningful when both options are defensible, both have real costs, and the outcome genuinely differs based on the decision.

The current trait axes are:

| Axis | Pole | Opposite Pole |
|------|------|---------------|
| 1 | Just | Dutiful |
| 2 | Direct | Clever |
| 3 | Bold | Cautious (Curious) |

Note: Neither pole is "good" or "bad" morally—these are directions on a spectrum, and both represent legitimate approaches to life.

**What each axis captures:**

| Axis | Question it answers |
|------|---------------------|
| Just / Dutiful | What standard do you serve? |
| Direct / Clever | How do you approach problems? |
| Bold / Cautious | When do you commit? |

## The Anatomy of a Real Choice

### What Makes a Trait Choice Meaningful

A trait choice fails if:
- One option is obviously correct (moral or mechanical)
- The player lacks information to understand the stakes
- The outcome is the same regardless of choice
- The trait earned never matters again

A trait choice succeeds when:
- Reasonable people would disagree about the right answer
- The player has been shown why both options have merit
- Each path leads to different consequences
- The trait opens or closes future story opportunities

### The Cowardice Test

Before finalizing a trait choice, apply this test: **Can a player be proud of either choice?**

"I upheld my commitment even when it was hard" — pride in duty.
"I did what was right even though it cost me" — pride in justice.

"I confronted them openly and let them know where I stand" — pride in directness.
"I found the angle and outmaneuvered them" — pride in cleverness.

"I seized the moment before it passed" — pride in boldness.
"I learned what I needed to know first" — pride in caution.

All pass. But:

"I ran away because I was scared" — shame, not pride.
"I schemed because I was too weak to face them" — shame, not pride.

If one pole of your axis feels like failure or weakness, the axis is broken for that scenario. Rework until both directions feel like *character*, not *deficiency*.

### The Circumstance Test

A second test: **Does the choice reveal character or just circumstances?**

Bad: "Give silver to the beggar (you have 20 silver)" — reveals nothing; generosity is cheap.
Bad: "Fight the guard (DC 3 with your +5 Might)" — reveals nothing; it's the obvious tactical choice.

Good: "Give your last healing potion before the dangerous climb" — reveals priorities.
Good: "Fight now or wait for reinforcements that may not come" — reveals approach to risk.

The choice should say something about *who the player is*, not just *what resources they have*.

## Story Structure for Trait Quests

Trait choices require setup. A player cannot make a meaningful decision about justice vs. duty if they don't understand both sides. This means trait quests need deliberate pacing.

### Scene-by-Scene Framework

**Scene 1 — Initiation: Plant the Seeds**

Introduce the situation without revealing the dilemma. The player accepts the quest for straightforward reasons (help someone, earn money, investigate a problem). 

Subtle foreshadowing: introduce characters or details that will matter when the choice arrives. If this is a just/dutiful quest, mention the law casually. If it's bold/cautious, hint at both the opportunity and the danger.

*The player should not yet know what kind of choice awaits them.*

**Scene 2 — Development: Build Both Sides**

This is where you establish the legitimacy of both options. For each axis:

| Axis | Show why one pole is valid | Show why the other pole is valid |
|------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Just / Dutiful | The established order causes real harm here | The order exists for real reasons—stability, trust, protection |
| Direct / Clever | Openness builds trust and clarity | Indirection preserves options and safety |
| Bold / Cautious | Acting now captures an opportunity or prevents harm | Investigating first reveals what bold action would miss |

This is the hardest scene to write. You must make the player *genuinely uncertain* about what they'll choose—not because they lack information, but because both paths have real merit.

Techniques:
- Introduce a sympathetic character on each side of the dilemma
- Show the costs of each approach through NPC stories or history
- Let the player gather information that complicates their initial assumptions

**Scene 3 — Escalation: Raise the Stakes**

Make it personal. Remove easy exits. The player may have been thinking "I'll find a third way" — now they can't.

This scene should:
- Increase the consequences of the coming choice
- Foreclose compromise solutions
- Create urgency (the choice must be made soon)

If the player could still avoid choosing, the trait moment won't land.

**Scene 4 — Choice: The Decision Point**

Present both options clearly. The player should understand exactly what they're choosing and what it will cost.

Design principles:
- Both options should be *available* — no skill checks or items that gate one path
- Labels should be neutral — don't editorialize ("Betray your friend" vs. "Do the right thing")
- Consequences should be implied but not exhaustively previewed

The trait is typically awarded in this scene as part of the player's chosen path.

**Scene 5 — Resolution: Consequences Unfold**

The world responds differently based on the choice. This is where the player sees that their decision *mattered*.

Consequences should include:
- Immediate outcome differences (who is helped, harmed, changed)
- NPC reactions that reflect the choice
- World state changes that future quests can reference
- Seeds for future callbacks ("The servant you helped now works at the Tavern")

### Compressed Structure (3 Scenes)

For shorter quests, combine scenes:

- **Scene 1**: Initiation + early Development (introduce situation, hint at both sides)
- **Scene 2**: Escalation + Choice (stakes become clear, player decides)
- **Scene 3**: Resolution (consequences)

This works but requires tighter writing. The player has less time to appreciate both sides of the dilemma.

## Axis-Specific Design Guidance

### Just / Dutiful

**Core tension:** Established order says one thing; personal conviction of what's right says another.

"Established order" is broader than law. It includes:
- **Laws and regulations** — formal rules with formal enforcement
- **Social norms** — the "traditional" role of women, expectations about class, who belongs where
- **Traditions** — "we've always done it this way," seasonal rituals, inherited practices
- **Oaths and promises** — commitments made that now conflict with conscience
- **Family expectations** — the obligation to follow a parent's trade, marry appropriately, care for elders in specific ways
- **Guild rules and professional codes** — secrets kept within trades, standards of practice

A woman who wants to captain a fishing boat in Limwater breaks no law, but she defies something real—and faces real consequences. A healer who shares guild secrets with a desperate outsider. A child who refuses to take over the family business. These are all just/dutiful dilemmas without a single statute involved.

**Prerequisites for a meaningful choice:**
- An established expectation exists (not necessarily a law)
- Following that expectation causes harm or prevents good in this case
- Defying it has real social, relational, or practical consequences

**Common failure modes:**
- The established order is cartoonishly oppressive → choosing dutiful feels villainous
- The person defying norms is unsympathetic or reckless → choosing just feels foolish
- The player never sees why the norm exists → dutiful has no merit
- Defiance has no consequences → just is obviously correct

**Setup requirements:**
- Establish what the expectation is and why people follow it (tradition, stability, genuine past wisdom)
- Show how it fails or harms in this specific case
- Make clear what defiance will cost (reputation, relationships, future opportunities, safety)

**Example scenarios:**

*Legal:*
1. Player discovers escaped indentured servant hiding in town
2. Learns the servant was abused (just case) BUT the master has legal claim and is searching (dutiful pressure)
3. Master arrives, demands help locating "his property"
4. Choice: Reveal the servant's location / Help them escape or hide
5. Consequence: Servant stays in town as tavern worker (just) OR leaves with master, but player earns favor with authorities (dutiful)

*Social norm:*
1. A fisherman's widow asks the player to help her take over her late husband's boat
2. The guild doesn't forbid it, but no woman has ever captained a vessel; the other fishermen are hostile
3. Helping her means opposing people the player may need later; refusing means she loses her livelihood
4. Choice: Advocate for her publicly / Encourage her to sell the boat and find "appropriate" work
5. Consequence: She succeeds but the player is marked as a troublemaker (just) OR she accepts her diminished lot, and the player remains in good standing (dutiful)

*Family expectation:*
1. A young blacksmith confides they want to become a scholar, but their aging parent needs them in the forge
2. The parent has sacrificed everything to build the business for their child
3. The player can encourage the child to follow their dreams or honor their obligation
4. Choice: Help them leave for the university / Convince them their duty is here
5. Consequence: Parent struggles alone, child flourishes elsewhere (just) OR child stays, grows resentful but family endures (dutiful)

**Good test questions:**
- Would someone who values stability and tradition hesitate to defy this norm?
- Would someone who values fairness and individual dignity hesitate to uphold it?
- If both would hesitate, the choice is real

### Direct / Clever

**Core tension:** Do you take the obvious path or find the angle? Confront openly or maneuver around? Transparent methods or strategic indirection?

- **Direct:** You address problems openly. Walk through the front door. Confront people to their face. State your terms plainly. Your methods are visible and your intentions clear.

- **Clever:** You find the angle. Work around obstacles rather than through them. Use misdirection, leverage, positioning. The side door, the overheard conversation, the trap set three steps ago.

In a working-class port town like Limwater, clever isn't optional—it's how you survive when you can't match strength against strength. But direct has value too: it builds reputation, tells people where you stand, creates alliances based on trust rather than maneuvering.

**Prerequisites for a meaningful choice:**
- An obstacle that could be approached either way
- Real advantages to directness (clarity, trust, reputation)
- Real advantages to cleverness (safety, leverage, surprise)
- Consequences that differ based on approach

**Common failure modes:**
- Direct approach requires overwhelming strength → cleverness is obviously correct for underdogs
- Clever approach has no risk of exposure → directness feels naive
- Both approaches lead to identical outcomes → choice is cosmetic
- Clever is framed as "smart" and direct as "dumb" → fails the cowardice test

**The key challenge for authors:**

Direct must not feel naive, and clever must not feel like the "smart" answer. Both need to be *competent* approaches with different trade-offs.

| Direct tends to... | Clever tends to... |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| Create clear relationships (ally or enemy, everyone knows where they stand) | Preserve ambiguity (they might not know it was you) |
| Burn bridges (you confronted them; they know) | Create complicated entanglements (secrets, leverage, debts) |
| Require leverage or strength to succeed | Risk exposure if the trick unravels |
| Build reputation for trustworthiness | Build reputation for cunning |

**Setup requirements:**

These choices often emerge naturally from obstacle-based scenarios:
- Getting past a barrier (guards, locks, social gatekeepers)
- Confronting wrongdoing
- Negotiating for something you want
- Gathering information someone doesn't want to share

The setup needs to establish that both approaches are *viable*—direct isn't suicidal, clever isn't trivially easy.

**Example scenarios:**

*Getting past an obstacle:*
1. Player needs information from the harbormaster's records
2. Could request access formally (direct) or find another way in (clever)
3. Choice: Present yourself and make your case / Find an angle—bribe a clerk, sneak in after hours, befriend someone with access
4. Consequences:
   - Direct: Harbormaster knows your interest; if legitimate, you have a contact; if suspicious, you're now watched
   - Clever: You have the information but owe someone, or carry the risk of being discovered later

*Confronting wrongdoing:*
1. Player discovers the merchant is selling spoiled goods
2. Could accuse them publicly (direct) or set them up to expose themselves (clever)
3. Choice: Denounce them in the market / Arrange for a buyer to "discover" the problem publicly
4. Consequences:
   - Direct: Merchant knows you're the enemy; clear moral victory but you've made a determined foe
   - Clever: Merchant is exposed but doesn't know you caused it; you have leverage, or an unwitting ally

*Negotiation:*
1. Player wants a better price from the fence for recovered goods
2. Could state their terms plainly (direct) or maneuver (clever)
3. Choice: "I know what these are worth. Pay fairly or I walk." / Imply you have another buyer, drop hints about the goods' provenance, let them talk themselves into a higher offer
4. Consequences:
   - Direct: Fence respects your backbone or resents your inflexibility; either way, they know who they're dealing with
   - Clever: Better price perhaps, but fence knows you're a schemer; future dealings are more guarded

*The escaped servant (showing all three axes):*
1. Player decides to help the servant (Just)
2. Now: confront the master directly or arrange things quietly?
3. Choice: Stand before the master and refuse to help / Ensure the servant has "already moved on" before the master even asks you
4. Consequences:
   - Direct: Master knows you defied him; you've made an enemy but also shown the town where you stand
   - Clever: Master suspects but can't prove; servant is safe but you carry a secret

**Good test questions:**
- Does the direct approach feel competent and brave, not foolish?
- Does the clever approach feel strategic and resourceful, not cowardly?
- Would someone who values straightforwardness genuinely prefer the direct path?
- Would someone who values cunning genuinely prefer the clever path?
- Do the outcomes differ in ways that matter for future interactions?

### Bold / Cautious (or Bold / Curious)

**Core tension:** Acting decisively now versus investigating further first. Assertion versus inquiry. Both are *forward motion*—this is not action versus inaction.

The cautious path is often the *curious* path. "I want to understand before I commit." The bold path says "I know enough—time to act." Neither is passive; they're different vectors through the same problem.

This reframing is crucial: if cautious means "don't do the thing," it's not a real choice—it's just declining to play. Cautious must mean "do a *different* thing that yields different results."

**Prerequisites for a meaningful choice:**
- A genuine opportunity that may diminish or disappear with time
- Genuine information or advantage that investigation could reveal
- Both paths must lead somewhere *different*, not the same destination via different routes

**Common failure modes:**
- Bold is just a skill check; cautious is "come back when you're stronger" → not a character choice
- Cautious path offers only safety, no discovery → boldness is obviously superior
- Both paths converge to the same outcome → the choice is cosmetic
- Cautious is framed as fear rather than strategy → fails the cowardice test

**The key design principle:**

Bold and cautious must reach *different endings*, not the same ending via different routes. Neither is "correct"—they're different stories.

| Bold discovers... | Cautious discovers... |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| The immediate threat | The larger pattern |
| Who did it | Why they did it |
| The symptom | The cause |
| Victory now | Advantage later |

**Setup requirements:**
- Show the opportunity and why timing matters
- Hint at what deeper investigation might reveal
- Establish that both paths are viable but lead to different places

**Example scenarios:**

*Investigation (thief pursuit):*
1. Player spots the suspected thief leaving town with a suspicious package
2. Could confront them now before they escape OR follow them to discover their contact
3. Time pressure: the thief will reach the town border soon
4. Choice: Confront now / Follow and observe
5. Consequences:
   - Bold: Recovers the stolen goods, thief is caught, accomplices remain unknown. Immediate justice.
   - Cautious: Thief escapes with goods, but player identifies the fence and smuggling route. Conspiracy revealed.

*Social (confrontation vs. inquiry):*
1. Player suspects the innkeeper is watering the ale and overcharging travelers
2. Could accuse him publicly OR quietly investigate his suppliers and ledgers
3. Choice: Confront him in front of customers / Dig into his business first
4. Consequences:
   - Bold: Innkeeper is shamed, situation resolved quickly, but player has made an enemy with no leverage
   - Cautious: Player discovers the innkeeper is being extorted by someone else—the real problem is upstream

*Opportunity (time-sensitive offer):*
1. A merchant offers the player a "one-time" chance to invest in a cargo shipment
2. The returns sound extraordinary; the merchant is leaving tomorrow
3. Could commit now OR spend the evening asking around about this merchant's reputation
4. Choice: Invest now / Investigate first
5. Consequences:
   - Bold: If legitimate, big reward; if a con, big loss. Player committed based on instinct.
   - Cautious: Learn the truth, but if it was legitimate, the opportunity has sailed (literally). Player committed based on knowledge.

*Danger (the Haunted Grove):*
1. Strange lights have been seen in the Haunted Grove; a child went missing nearby
2. Could venture in immediately while the trail is fresh OR ask the old-timers what they know about the Grove first
3. Choice: Go now / Gather knowledge
4. Consequences:
   - Bold: Find the child quickly (good or bad outcome), but stumble into dangers unprepared
   - Cautious: Learn about the Grove's patterns and hazards, but the trail grows cold; different encounter when you arrive

**Good test questions:**
- Does the cautious path *discover* something the bold path cannot?
- Does the bold path *achieve* something the cautious path cannot?
- Is cautious an active choice (investigate, inquire, observe) rather than a passive one (wait, avoid, delay)?
- Would an experienced tactician genuinely debate the right approach?

## Frequency and Pacing

### Not Every Quest Needs a Trait Choice

Trait choices carry weight partly because they're not constant. If every quest demands a character-defining decision, players will:
- Experience decision fatigue
- Start optimizing for mechanical benefit rather than roleplaying
- Find the choices less meaningful through sheer repetition

**Recommended frequency:** Major trait choices in roughly one-third to one-half of quests.

### Signaling Trait Quests

Players should sense when a character-defining moment is approaching—not the specific choice, but the *weight* of what's coming. This builds anticipation and encourages engagement with the setup scenes.

Techniques:
- Moral language in NPC dialogue ("What would you do in my position?")
- References to principles, oaths, or past decisions
- Rising emotional stakes
- Removal of easy options

### Trait Choice vs. Trait Texture

Not every trait award needs to be a major decision point. Smaller moments can reinforce existing tendencies:

- **Major choice:** The climax of a quest, with full setup and consequences
- **Minor texture:** A passing option that nudges the trait axis slightly

Example of texture: A quest primarily about something else includes an optional moment where bold players can take a small risk for a small reward. It's not the point of the quest, but it reinforces character.

Use texture sparingly—it should feel like the world noticing who you are, not like a constant trait tax on every action.

## Consequences and Callbacks

### Immediate Consequences

The resolution scene must demonstrate that the choice mattered. Minimally:
- Different dialogue from NPCs
- Different world state (who is where, what happened)
- Different rewards (not necessarily better/worse, but different)

### Long-term Callbacks

The real payoff for trait choices comes when future quests recognize what you did.

**Trait-gated options:** A player with `trait:just*3` might see a hidden option to vouch for another accused person. A player with `trait:dutiful*3` might get access to official channels.

**NPC memory:** The escaped servant now works at the Tavern. They recognize you—with gratitude or fear, depending on your choice.

**Reputation effects:** Word spreads. A just player might find other desperate people seeking help. A dutiful player might find authorities more cooperative.

### Designing for Callbacks

When writing a trait quest, document:
- What world state changes based on each choice?
- What NPCs are affected and how would they react later?
- What future scenarios would plausibly check for this trait?

This documentation helps future quest authors create meaningful callbacks.

## Checklist for Trait Quests

Before finalizing a quest with a major trait choice:

### Setup Verification
- [ ] Both sides of the dilemma are shown sympathetically
- [ ] Player has information needed to understand the stakes
- [ ] Neither option is obviously "correct"

### Choice Verification
- [ ] Both options are available (no gating by items or skill checks)
- [ ] Labels are neutral and descriptive
- [ ] The cowardice test passes (player can be proud of either choice)
- [ ] The circumstance test passes (choice reveals character, not just resources)

### Consequence Verification
- [ ] Resolution scene differs meaningfully based on choice
- [ ] NPCs react appropriately to the player's decision
- [ ] World state changes are documented for future callbacks
- [ ] The trait earned will be checked in at least one future quest

### Pacing Verification
- [ ] Player doesn't know the specific choice in Scene 1
- [ ] Both sides are developed before the decision point
- [ ] Compromise is foreclosed before Scene 4
- [ ] Consequences are shown, not just stated

## Common Pitfalls

### The False Dilemma
One option is clearly better. Usually happens when the author has a preferred answer and unconsciously weights the setup.

**Fix:** Write the strongest case for the option you like less. If you can't make it genuinely appealing, the dilemma isn't ready.

### The Cosmetic Choice
Both paths lead to the same outcome. The trait is awarded but nothing else changes.

**Fix:** Write the resolution scene for each path first. If they're too similar, redesign the consequences.

### The Information Deficit
Player chooses without understanding what they're choosing. The trait feels arbitrary.

**Fix:** Ensure development scenes provide all necessary context. Test by asking: "Could a player make this choice for reasons, not randomly?"

### The Isolated Moment
The trait is awarded but never matters again. Player forgets they earned it.

**Fix:** Document callback opportunities when writing the quest. Plan at least one future use for the trait before finalizing.

### The Overloaded Quest
Too many trait axes in one quest. Player faces multiple character-defining moments in quick succession.

**Fix:** One major trait choice per quest. Additional axes can appear as minor texture at most.
